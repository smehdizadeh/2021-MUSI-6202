Q4.3:
With the rectangular window, you see most of the energy of the signal contained in the fundamental
and first harmonic, with a sharp drop off for the rest of the harmonics.

With the hanning window, you can start to see "smearing" in the frequency domain,
with relatively less energy in the fundamental and first harmonic, and 
more the second and third harmonics than before.
